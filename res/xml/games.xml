            <title>Level 9 Computing</title>
            <about>Level 9 published 20 games, and were in one way or the other connected to a number of other games.

This extraordinary feat makes them the second largest text adventure company right after Infocom, blatantly ignoring Sierra On-Line (whose early and middle-period games did have text parsers after all, but counting the 3D-animated adventures as text adventures would be pushing the definition).

They were founded in 1981 by Pete, Mike, and Nick Austin: Mike was a fan of Advent (aka Colossal Cave) and was disappointed that there was no port for the British micro computers, so he simply wrote his own - and that's how it began, concerning text adventures. Before that, they had already published software for 8bit computers, such as Extension Basic, and a couple of arcade games for the Nascom. 

The decision to publish the games mainly on tape and to port them to many platforms made them the leading adventure company in England. Furthermore, their games featured a decent parser with a dictionary of sometimes 1000 words and more, making them the most advanced adventure games ever available on tape. Needless to say, this added to their success: Scapeghost, their last and least-successful game, still sold about 15,000 copies. 

The commercial decline of the text adventure genre finally forced them to close down in June 1991, after they had desperately tried to stay in business by selling their programming efforts to other companies.

        <game name="info_acode">
            <title>A-Code</title>
            <about>Level 9 used their own interpretation language, A-code, which was more memory efficient even than plain Z80 assembler. It was developed around 1979, long before the first L9 game appeared, as the Colossal Cave port was intended to fit into 8 KB.

A-code underwent a couple of revisions: there are three distinct versions in all, plus a couple of extensions which form new A-code versions of their own.

The A-code data files were usually incorporated into the executable file for specific machines, together with the interpreter part. Still, even those executables were significantly shorter than pure assembly code files would have been!

This efficiency was partially due to advanced text compression routines that reduced the memory need for texts to about 50% of their true length. Infocom's text compression, in comparison, only reduced text strings to about 67% of their real length (abbreviation alphabets notwithstanding: see elsewhere for details).

A strength of the A-code system - and at the same time one of its greatest weaknesses - is a system of script variables, of which there are a fixed number: generally more in higher A-code versions.

For the later three-part games, Knight Orc, Scapeghost, and the Ingrid series, the script variable system was extended by an NPC movement and action system which was internally called KAOS. The framework of this new system was originally developed by John Jones-Steele who had gained first experiences at Melbourne House. KAOS was able to make NPCs appear "intelligent": they move independently of the player's commands, pick up things, utilise weapons, etc., following so-called "racetracks," which could be quite complex (as Knight Orc demonstrates impressively). The name "KAOS" is a mangled acronym of "Knight Orc Adventure System."

Finally, an animation control system named HUGE (The (w)Holy Universal Game Engine) was added, which was actually a new system on its own, but derived from A-code. HUGE drivers existed for the Amiga and Atari ST only. It was never used for issued Level 9 games, but e.g. their conversion of It Came from the Desert was programmed using HUGE.

        <game name="info_how2play">
            <title>How to play</title>
            <about>Game uses an advanced command language interpreter (called a 'parser') that understands both simple one or two word commands and complex multiple command sentences. This chapter is split into sections describing ways in which to communicate with the program.

1. Movement
To move around the land, use the following commands:

NORTH (N), NORTHEAST (NE), EAST (E), SOUTHEAST (SE), SOUTH (S), SOUTHWEST (SW), WEST (W), NORTHWEST (NW), UP (U), DOWN (D), INSIDE (IN), OUTSIDE (OUT), CLIMB, JUMP, CROSS
The EXITS command will list any likely exits.

2. Actions
The majority of commands that you will use are actions. Such as picking up objects, opening doors, lighting lamps, etc. Here are some examples of the most common action commands.

Command - Meaning:

GET THE SPANNER - Pick up the spanner from here.
DROP THE BLACK PISTOL - Leave the black pistol in this room.
GIVE THE DRINK TO THE ROBOT - Refresh the robot with my drink.
PUSH THE RED BUTTON - Press only the button that is red.
WEAR HELMET - Put on the helmet that I'm carrying.
OPEN THE DOOR - Open the door
CUT THE TUBE WITH THE SCALPEL - Sever the tube using my scalpel.
EXAMINE THE COFFIN - Take a good look at the coffin.
INVENTORY (INV) - What am I carrying?
SCORE - How well am I doing?
QUIT - Abandon your quest.
AGAIN (A) - Repeat the last command entered.

You can use punctuation, or the word AND to string together multiple commands, for example...

OPEN THE DOOR. GO SOUTH AND CLOSE THE DOOR. GO EAST AND PULL THE GREEN LEVER.

The parser also understands the words ALL and EVERYTHING to mean everything moveable that it can see. This is an extremely useful time-saving feature. In most other adventures, to pick up a number of objects, you would have to do the following...

GET RATCHET
GET BOLT
GET CLOTH

Without using the ALL command, game would allow you to use...

GET RATCHET, BOLT AND CLOTH

But this can be abbreviated even more simply to...

GET ALL

Another useful feature is the ability to refer to the last used item/object as IT, for example...

EXAMINE THE BLUE SWITCH AND PRESS IT
or...
GET THE GREEN FLASK AND FILL IT WITH WATER.

Exceptions are also understood by the parser, such as...

TAKE EVERYTHING BUT THE COMPASS
or...
EXAMINE ALL EXCEPT THE WATCH

Using all of these command structures allows you to type in near-English sentences of great complexity, such as...

EXAMINE ALL BUT THE WATCH, SPANNER AND TORCH AND GO EAST.
DROP EVERYTHING BUT THE FLASK. OPEN IT AND GIVE IT TO THE ROBOT.
GET THE KEYS. OPEN THE SLIDING DOOR AND RUN NORTHWEST THEN INVENTORY. WHAT IS MY SCORE?

3. Special commands

There are a few commands that are neither movement or actions. Two of these affect the way the adventure is presented to you; they are...

WORDS Turn off the pictures.
PICTURES Turn them back on again.

A HELP feature has been included, to give you a clue at certain points within the games. The HELP command is generally useful in the locations around the start of each adventure, to get you on your way.

The other commands are concerned with saving and restoring your game position. Full instructions will be displayed on the screen where necessary.

SAVE Stores game position to your filing system.
RESTORE Loads a saved game position.
RAM SAVE Stores game position in the computer's memory.
RAM RESTORE Loads a RAM SAVEd position from the computer's memory.
OOPS Restore position as it was before you last moved. OOPS is a very useful command, and versions on larger machines let you use it several times in succession to go back a long way in time.
Naturally, you can use OOPS, RESTORE or RAM RESTORE, even when you have just been killed, so that you can return to your position before your fatal accident!

Introduction
------------

During the 1980s a small British company called Level 9, run by two brothers (Mike and Pete Austin), produced a series of text adventure games for a variety of computers. These games received considerable critical acclaim and are probably the best text adventures written for the small cassette based 8 bit computers common in Britain in the 80s.

Level 9 wrote their games using a custom designed system known as "A-Code", which evolved from games on the 8 bit computers such as the Acorn BBC Model B, the Sinclair Spectrum and the Commodore 64 to the (then new) 16 bit machines such as the Amiga and the Atari ST.

From disassembly of Level 9 games there are thought to be four variants of A-Code, which are detailed below, and all of which are supported by this interpreter. Thanks go to Paul David Doherty for analysing the games and producing the table which follows.

  v1    This was used for the earliest games. Spectrum v1 games had black text on a grey background. Games known to be released in this format:

                Colossal Adventure
                Adventure Quest
                Dungeon Adventure
                Snowball
                Lords of Time

  v2    These releases were made between 1984 and 1985 (and usually say so in the initial copyright message). This version introduced the yellow text on a black background which became standard. Games in this format were:

                Adventure Quest
                Dungeon Adventure
                Lords of Time
                Snowball
                Return to Eden
                Erik the Viking
                Emerald Isle
                Red Moon

  v3    This format, dated 1986, was used by the largest number of releases. These were:

                Worm in Paradise
                The Price of Magick
                The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole
                The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole
                The Archers
                The Jewels of Darkness Trilogy (Colossal Adventure,
                Adventure Quest and Dungeon Adventure released as
                one package)
                The Silicon Dreams Trilogy
                (Snowball, Return to Eden and Worm in Paradise)

  v4    This was used for the Time and Magick Trilogy (Lords of Time, Red Moon and The Price of Magick), and all Level 9's new games from 1987 onwards:

                Knight Orc
                Gnome Ranger
                Ingrid's Back
                Lancelot
                Scapeghost


Supported Formats
-----------------

On several machines (such as the Amiga) Level 9 games were distributed as an interpreter plus a data file, usually called "gamedata.dat" or something similar. These games can be played with this interpreter simply by loading the "gamedata.dat" file.

For the Amiga (and some other formats) the v4 games were released in three parts, each in a separate data file:

        gamedat1.dat
        gamedat2.dat
        gamedat3.dat

Starting the first game gives a menu from which you can choose which part or game to play. For this to work the files must have the same basic structure with a number in it somewhere, e.g. file names 

        TimeAndMagick1.dat
        TimeAndMagick2.dat
        TimeAndMagick3.dat

will work.

On other (especially older and smaller) computers the games were distributed as a single file containing both an interpreter and the game data. Level9 can cope with these files as well, as it automatically searches files for valid Level 9 games. This however requires that the file not be compressed in any way. For example, there are several Spectrum snapshots of Level 9 games available which this interpreter can play, but these snapshots mustbe in an uncompressed format (e.g. SNA). Commonly snapshots are available in the compressed Z80 format, but these files can be converted to SNA using the widely available conversion program "SPConv". Version 1.06 or higher of "SPConv" is recommended.

Paul David Doherty has written "L9Cut", which can extract Level 9 games from many different formats. L9Cut can also remove copy protection from Level 9 games. L9Cut can be downloaded from

  http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXlevel9Xtools.html

This program has been tested on files obtained from releases for the Amiga, Atari ST, IBM PC, C-64, Spectrum, Atari 800, BBC, Amstrad CPC, Apple 2, Apple Mac and MSX computers.


Graphics
--------

The first games from Level 9 were text only, but later games included line-drawn graphics, and then bitmap graphics for the last games. These graphics are supported by some versions of the interpreter (The 32-bit DOS version does support graphics, while the 16-bit DOS version does not.).

On some platforms the line-drawn graphics were placed into separate files (For example, in the Amiga release of "Jewels of Darkness" the game is in "gamedata.dat" and the graphics in "picture.dat".). In order to show these pictures the graphics file can be passed as a second command line argument when starting the interpreter. If no graphics file is specified in this way, the interpreter will look for a file with the same name as the game data, but with a file extension of ".pic", ".cga" or ".hrc" (the latter two being used for graphics files in MS-DOS Level 9 releases).

If no line-drawn graphics file is specified, Level 9 will search the given game data file for graphics data. This is useful when the game data is a Spectrum SNA snapshot or a similar memory dump of an emulator.

The last Level 9 games use bitmap graphics. The interpreter can display the bitmap graphics from C64, Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Apple Macintosh, BBC B, Amstrad CPC and Spectrum +3 versions of the games (though for the last three, there is currently no way to extract the A-code game data in a usable form).

The graphics files contain a number somewhere in the file name, and there may also be a title picture with a different file name. The interpreter searches for suitably named graphics files using the following rules. In all cases copy the graphics and title files to the same directory as the game.

Amiga, Macintosh and some Atari ST
  The graphics file name is just the number (e.g. "1", "2", etc.). The title file is called "title".

Later Atari ST
  The graphics file name is the number with a "squ" file extension (e.g. "1.squ", "2.squ", etc.). The title file is just one of the normal graphics files.

MS-DOS
  The graphics file name is the number with a "pic" file extension (e.g. "1.pic", "2.pic", etc.). The title file is just one of the normal graphics files.

C64
  The graphics file name is "pic" followed by the number (e.g. "pic1", "pic2", etc.). The title file is called "title mpic".

BBC B "Lancelot"
  As for C64, except that the title file is called "title".

BBC B except "Lancelot"
  The graphics file name is "P.Pic" followed by the number (e.g. "P.Pic1", "P.Pic2", etc.). The title file is called "P.Title".

Amstrad CPC and Spectrum +3
  All but the first graphic are contained in a single file called "allpics.pic". The first graphics file is "1.pic" and the title file is "title.pic".


Meta Commands
-------------

Level9 supports several meta commands, which can be entered on the input line. These commands are handled by the interpreter rather than being passed to the game. They are:

  #save         Saves out a game position directly, bypassing any prompting (such as for disk changes).

  #restore      Loads in a saved position directly, bypassing any protection code within the game.

  #quit         Quits the current game.

  #cheat        Tries to bypass the copy protection code which asks for a specific word. This is done by trying every word in the game's dictionary. On a slow machine, this can take a long time.

  #dictionary   Lists the game dictionary. Press a key to stop the listing and return to the input line.

  #picture      If graphics are available, shows the picture specified as a number after the picture command, e.g. "#picture 520".

  #seed         Sets the seed of the random number generator to the value given, e.g. "#seed 42". This will make randomness within the game predictable, which is useful for testing.

  #play         Prompts the user for a text file from which to read further input from. Input lines are read from the file until the end is reached, at which point the game reverts to asking the user for input.

The 32-bit DOS version of Level 9 also supports several hotkeys. Press Alt-H when playing a game to view a list of the available hotkeys.


History
-------

  v5.1
The bitmap graphics from the US Macintosh release of Lancelot now display correctly.

  v5.0
V1 games are also now supported.
The input logic now correctly handles commas and full stops in the user's input for v3 or later games.
The input logic now allows hyphens and apostrophes to be input, which is needed for some v2 games.
The dictionary listing for v2 games no longer has junk on the end.
The graphics detection algorithm has been improved, so that it now correctly finds graphics in all known games.
A difference in the logic between the v2 and v3 line-drawn graphics has been implemented, which corrects the scaling for some v2 graphics.
Added #seed and #play meta commands.

  v4.1
Corrected a bug that made Lancelot unplayable.
BBC B bitmaps are now shown as they appeared on the original computer.

  v4.0
Implemented support for bitmap graphics.

  v3.0
Implemented support for line-drawn graphics.
Fixed a problem with v4 detection that stopped some versions of Scapeghost running correctly.
Implemented an opcode used by the disk based versions of Time and Magick, which now means that saving from these games works.
The interpreter now gives you a reasonable amount of time to enter the Lenslok code in protected games, and also tells you what the code should be.

  v2.0
Revised the description of v4 games to include all the post-1987 games, which are now supported.
V2 games are also now supported.
Added meta commands.

  v1.0
First release.


Credits
-------

The Level9 interpreter was originally written by Glen Summers. The changes for version 3.0 were made by David Kinder with additional code from Alan Staniforth and Simon Baldwin.

For version 4.0, David Kinder integrated the various bitmap decoders, but all the difficult work was done by Alan Staniforth and Dieter Baron. Alan also supplied the BBC B bitmap changes for version 4.1.

David and Andreas Scherrer worked on version 5.0 to integrate script playback from Andreas' .NET port of the interpreter. Andreas created a test harness to play through all the games, and David and Andreas then worked through the problems this showed up. Andreas also put much effort into painstakingly checking all the graphics in the games, which revealed several issues.

Help, testing and information on the various Level 9 formats was provided by Paul David Doherty. Testing of the fix for Lancelot in version 4.1 was performed by Guido Mureddu.

			<about>Rummaging in the attic, you discover a wrinkled balloon with tiny white writing, too small to make out. Intrigued, you blow and the balloon swells like a red globe. Then it bursts.

As the echos fade, you re-open your eyes and look in astonishment upon a bleak landscape of mist and swamp. Writing glimmers in the darkness: "Welcome to the House of the Red Moon."

This is a game about magic. At the start you know absolutely nothing about its methods and powers, except that there are 18 spells to learn. To win, you must know everything.</about>

			<title>The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13&#190;</title>
			<about>I learned today that I am to be the subject of a computer game. The object of the game is to make me popular with everyone, which sounds dead brilliant. Apparently they´ve written an enormous programme containing 200 kilos of text, which Brainbox Henderson says is a lot. Now everyone else can have or go at coping with all the problems that beset me over an entire year of my life.</about>

			<title>The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole</title>
			<about>Whether you have read Sue Townsend's best-selling books or not, you should have no trouble guiding Adrian through the trials and tribulations of school and family life! Knowing the books won't necessarily give you an advantage: in the game, familiar scenes may well have a new twist There are a number of random elements included so each game may be different. Adrian's view of the world is unique and entertaining and you help make decisions about all aspects of his life. He is surrounded by colourful characters and you will need to consider carefully the best way to impress them! Your ultimate aim is to make Adrian as popular as possible with everyone and at regular points in the game your score will appear as an indication of how well you are doing. (You could, of course, play it the other way and try to make Adrian as unpopular as possible!)</about>
